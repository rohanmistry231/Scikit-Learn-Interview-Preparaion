# Learning and Validation Curves (`sklearn.model_selection`)

## 📖 Introduction
Learning and validation curves diagnose model performance by analyzing training size and hyperparameter effects. This guide covers `learning_curve` and `validation_curve`, with examples and interview insights.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how to diagnose bias and variance using curves.
- Master `learning_curve` and `validation_curve`.
- Apply curves to optimize model performance.
- Interpret curves for imbalanced datasets.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Learning Curve**: Plots training and validation scores vs. training set size.
- **Validation Curve**: Plots scores vs. hyperparameter values.
- **Bias and Variance**: Diagnose underfitting (high bias) or overfitting (high variance).
- **Imbalanced Data**: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., F1 score) for evaluation.

## 📝 Example Walkthrough
The `learning_validation_curves.py` file demonstrates:
1. **Dataset**: Using the Iris dataset.
2. **Curves**: Generating `learning_curve` and `validation_curve` for a RandomForest.
3. **Diagnosis**: Analyzing curves to identify bias or variance.
4. **Imbalanced Data**: Applying curves to an imbalanced dataset.

Example code:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve
train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(RandomForestClassifier(), X, y, cv=5)
```

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks
1. Generate a learning curve for a RandomForest on the Iris dataset and interpret it.
2. Create a validation curve for `n_estimators` in RandomForest and find the optimal value.
3. Apply a learning curve to an underfit model (e.g., low `n_estimators`) and diagnose bias.
4. Use learning curves on an imbalanced dataset with `f1_macro` scoring.

## 💡 Interview Tips
- **Common Questions**:
  - How do learning curves help diagnose model performance?
  - What does a validation curve tell you about hyperparameters?
  - How do you identify overfitting from a learning curve?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain how curves reveal bias (low scores) vs. variance (large gap between scores).
  - Be ready to interpret a plotted curve during an interview.
  - Discuss the importance of appropriate metrics for imbalanced data.

# Other Decomposition Techniques (`sklearn.decomposition`)

## üìñ Introduction
Other decomposition techniques extract independent or latent factors from data. This guide covers `FastICA` (Independent Component Analysis) and `FactorAnalysis`, with practical examples and interview insights.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of FastICA and FactorAnalysis.
- Master their application for dimensionality reduction.
- Apply these methods for visualization and model improvement.
- Build pipelines with decomposition techniques.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **FastICA**: Separates data into statistically independent components, useful for signal separation.
- **FactorAnalysis**: Models data as latent factors plus noise, assumes Gaussian distributions.
- **Preprocessing**: Standardization ensures fair feature contributions.
- **Applications**: FastICA for blind source separation, FactorAnalysis for latent variable modeling.

## üìù Example Walkthrough
The `other_decomposition.py` file demonstrates:
1. **Dataset**: Iris dataset.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying `FastICA` and `FactorAnalysis` to reduce to 2 dimensions.
3. **Visualization**: Plotting FastICA-transformed data.
4. **Pipeline**: Combining FastICA with a classifier.

Example code:
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import FastICA
ica = FastICA(n_components=2, random_state=42)
X_ica = ica.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tasks
1. Apply `FastICA` to the Iris dataset and visualize the 2D projection.
2. Use `FactorAnalysis` and compare its results with FastICA.
3. Train a classifier with and without FastICA and compare accuracy.
4. Build a pipeline with `FactorAnalysis` and a classifier.

## üí° Interview Tips
- **Common Questions**:
  - What is the difference between FastICA and PCA?
  - When is FactorAnalysis appropriate?
  - What are typical applications of FastICA?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain FastICA‚Äôs focus on non-Gaussian independence.
  - Highlight FactorAnalysis‚Äôs latent factor modeling.
  - Be ready to code a FastICA pipeline and discuss signal separation.
